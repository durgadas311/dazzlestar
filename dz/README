DazzleStar Disassembler, The Next Generation

-- PRELIMINARY --

DAZZLESTAR

DazzleStar.jar contains a modern version of the DazzleStar Disassembler.
It currently only operates on COM files. It uses the modern "PC" keyboard
navigation keys to move around the file and window.  The commands
A(ddress) and F(ollow) may also be used, as well as select "breaks"
(without the "B" prefix). Menus perform the rest of the functions.

It currently does not implement all the features of the original
DazzleStar.


ANALYZER

Analyzer.jar contains an application to trace through a COM file
and establish code and data regions. It may be influenced by
a hints file. By default is uses the MAC80 (DRI Z80.LIB) mnemonics,
but the commandline option "zilog" may be used to select Zilog mnemonics.
It will read the COM file (.com), an optional "hints" file (.in),
and create a DZ file (.dz) and ASM file (.asm).

The hints file format is TBD.
