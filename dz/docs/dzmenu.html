<H2>DazzleStar Menus</H2>

<P>Basic operational functions are supplied in the menus.
Certain menu items are disabled or altered based on context.
For example, you can't "Close" a disassembly if none is open.

<DL>
<DT>File-&gt;New</DT>
<DD>Open a submenu for dialogs to load a new program file for disassembly.
This will discard any current disassembly. Submenus are:
<P>
	<DL>
	<DT>-&gt;Binary (.COM)</DT>
	<DD>Open a binary (e.g. COM) file.
	Allows override of ORG for file, enter hex value in box on right side
	of file dialog.
	The keyboard shortcut is <B>Alt-F-N-B</B>
	</DD>
	<DT>-&gt;PRL File</DT>
	<DD>Opens a PRL file, which contains relocation information used
	to construct the initial symbol table.
	Note that it will be necessary to run <B>Disas-&gt;Rebuild Symtab</B>
	(typically after identifying code sections) in order to
	create symbol entries for relative jumps (which do not appear
	in the relocation data).
	The keyboard shortcut is <B>Alt-F-N-P</B>
	</DD>
	<DT>-&gt;SPR File</DT>
	<DD>Opens an SPR file, which contains relocation information used
	to construct the initial symbol table.
	Some SPR files (e.g. BNKBIOS3.SPR) contain two program segments.
	<B>Disas-&gt;Rebuild Symtab</B> may be required, same as PRL files.
	The keyboard shortcut is <B>Alt-F-N-S</B>
	</DD>
	<DT>-&gt;REL File</DT>
	<DD>Opens a REL file, which contains a lot of information that
	is used to construct the initial symbol table. Note, this
	version combines all related segment snippets into a single
	segment, and thus does not reconstruct the original ASM file's
	interspersing of CSEG, DSEG, etc. This is done to keep the user
	interface simpler. Also, ASEG data is not loaded - if there was
	any contents (symbols are still constructed). This is similar
	to the handling of ASEG in LINK.
	<B>Disas-&gt;Rebuild Symtab</B> may be required, same as PRL files.
	The keyboard shortcut is <B>Alt-F-N-R</B>
	</DD>
	</DL>
<P>
</DD>
<DT>File-&gt;Close</DT>
<DD>This will discard any currently disassembly, effectively "closing" it.
</DD>
<DT>File-&gt;Generate ASM</DT>
<DD>Generates an ASM file for the current disassembly.
file is generated in the same folder as the COM file.
</DD>
<DT>File-&gt;Generate PRN</DT>
<DD>Generates a PRN (listing) file for the current disassembly.
file is generated in the same folder as the COM file.
</DD>
<DT>File-&gt;Save</DT>
<DD>Open a submenu for dialogs to save current progress. Submenus are:
	<DL>
	<DT>-&gt;Save DZ</DT>
	<DD>Generates a .DZ file for the current disassembly.
	file is generated in the same folder as the COM file.
	The keyboard shortcut is <B>Alt-F-S-D</B>
	</DD>
	<DT>-&gt;Save Hints</DT>
	<DD>Save current hints to file (.DZH), overwriting any previous contents.
	If no hints exist, pops up a warning and does nothing.
	The keyboard shortcut is <B>Alt-F-S-H</B>
	</DD>
	<DT>-&gt;Save Scan</DT>
	<DD>Save current code-scanner results (.DZS), overwriting any previous contents.
	If no scanner data exist, pops up a warning and does nothing.
	The keyboard shortcut is <B>Alt-F-S-S</B>
	</DD>
	</DL>
<DT>File-&gt;Load</DT>
<DD>Open a submenu for dialogs to load additional data. Submenus are:
	<DL>
	<DT>-&gt;Load DZ</DT>
	<DD>Open a dialog to loads a DZ file for the current disassembly.
	This replaces any existing breaks or symbols, effectively discarding those.
	This does not affect the folder used to generate output files.
	The keyboard shortcut is <B>Alt-F-L-D</B>
	</DD>
	<DT>-&gt;Load Hints</DT>
	<DD>Load code-scanner hints.
	See <A HREF="dzhints.html">Hint Syntax</A>.
	The keyboard shortcut is <B>Alt-F-L-H</B>
	</DD>
	<DT>-&gt;Load Scan</DT>
	<DD>Load code-scanner results.
	The keyboard shortcut is <B>Alt-F-L-S</B>
	</DD>
	</DL>
<DT>File-&gt;Quit</DT>
<DD>Discards any current disassembly and exits the program.
</DD>
<P>
<DT>Disas-&gt;Scan from here</DT>
<DD>(Re)Start auto-code scan from current location.
Note, the keyboard shortcut for this is <B>Alt-D-S</B>
</DD>
<DT>Disas-&gt;Scan Hints</DT>
<DD>Code scan all entry points from hints.
Only enabled if some exist.</DD>
<DT>Disas-&gt;Reset scan</DT>
<DD>Clear all code scan progress markers.
Used to start over fresh.</DD>
<DT>Disas-&gt;Apply Hint</DT>
<DD> Enter and apply a single hint.
Typically only useful for declaring inline function params.
The single hint will be added to the hints table,
and the current code will be scanned and calls to the
function will have breaks added for the inline parameters.
Note that calls which are hidden by previous mis-aligned breaks
will not be fixed.
See <A HREF="dzhints.html">Hint Syntax</A>.
</DD>
<DT>Disas-&gt;Rebuild Symtab</DT>
<DD>Discards any current symbols and rescans code according to
current breaks, building a new symbol table.
Note, the keyboard shortcut for this is <B>Alt-D-B</B>
</DD>
<DT>Disas-&gt;Use {MAC80|Zilog}</DT>
<DD>Change mnemonics used for disassembly of code.
Menu reflects the opposite of the current mnemonics, i.e.
what the mnemonics will be changed to.
Note, the keyboard shortcut for this is <B>Alt-D-U</B>
</DD>
