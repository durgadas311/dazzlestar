<P>Basic operational functions are supplied in the menus.
Certain menu items are disabled or altered based on context.
For example, you can't "Close" a disassembly if none is open.

<DL>
<DT>File->New</DT>
<DD>Open a dialog to load a new program file for disassembly.
This will discard any current disassembly.
Allows override of ORG for file, enter hex value in box on right side
of file dialog.
</DD>
<DT>File->Close</DT>
<DD>This will discard any currently disassembly, effectively "closing" it.
</DD>
<DT>File->Generate ASM</DT>
<DD>Generates an ASM file for the current disassembly.
file is generated in the same folder as the COM file.
</DD>
<DT>File->Generate PRN</DT>
<DD>Generates a PRN (listing) file for the current disassembly.
file is generated in the same folder as the COM file.
</DD>
<DT>File->Save DZ</DT>
<DD>Generates a DZ file for the current disassembly.
file is generated in the same folder as the COM file.
</DD>
<DT>File->Load DZ</DT>
<DD>Open a dialog to loads a DZ file for the current disassembly.
This replaces any existing breaks or symbols, effectively discarding those.
This does not affect the folder used to generate output files.
</DD>
<DT>File->Save Hints</DT>
<DD>Save current hints to file, overwriting any previous contents.
If no hints exist, pops up a warning and does nothing.
</DD>
<DT>File->Load Hints</DT>
<DD>Load code-scanner hints.
See <A HREF="dzhints.html">Hint Syntax</A>.
</DD>
<DT>File->Quit</DT>
<DD>Discards any current disassembly and exits the program.
</DD>
<P>
<DT>Disas->Scan from here</DT>
<DD>(Re)Start auto-code scan from current location.
Note, the keyboard shortcut for this is <B>Alt-D-Z</B>
</DD>
<DT>Disas->Scan Hints</DT>
<DD>Code scan all entry points from hints.
Only enabled if some exist.</DD>
<DT>Disas->Reset scan</DT>
<DD>Clear all code scan progress markers.
Used to start over fresh.</DD>
<DT>Disas->Apply Hint</DT>
<DD> Enter and apply a single hint.
Typically only useful for declaring inline function params.
The single hint will be added to the hints table,
and the current code will be scanned and calls to the
function will have breaks added for the inline parameters.
Note that calls which are hidden by previous mis-aligned breaks
will not be fixed.
See <A HREF="dzhints.html">Hint Syntax</A>.
</DD>
<DT>Disas->Rebuild Symtab</DT>
<DD>Discards any current symbols and rescans code according to
current breaks, building a new symbol table.
Note, the keyboard shortcut for this is <B>Alt-D-G</B>
</DD>
<DT>Disas->Use {MAC80|Zilog}</DT>
<DD>Change mnemonics used for disassembly of code.
Menu reflects the opposite of the current mnemonics, i.e.
what the mnemonics will be changed to.
Note, the keyboard shortcut for this is <B>Alt-D-M</B>
