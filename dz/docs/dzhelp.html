<P>The JAR file DazzleStar.jar implements a modern version of
the famous DazzleStar disassembler.

<UL><PRE>java -jar DazzleStar.jar [options]</PRE></UL>

<P>The configuration of the disassembler is driven by the configuration
file, which  is searched in the following way:
<OL>
<LI>The current directory is searched for "dzrc"
<LI>The path "~/.dzrc" is used (user's home directory)
</OL>
This file is plain text and consists
of lines in the format "property = value". Long values may be extended to
subsequent lines by using the back-slash to cause the subsequent line
to be attached to the value.

<P>The following properties control the basic functioning of the virtual
computer:

<DL>
<DT>code_win</DT>
<DD>The number of lines to display in the "Code Window" (disassemble code).
Default is 24.
</DD>

<DT>dump_win</DT>
<DD>The number of lines to display in the "Dump Window" (hex dump).
Default is 6.
</DD>

<DT>cursor_color</DT>
<DD>This selects the color to use for the "cursor" highlights in
the Code and Dump windows. Pick a color that works well with black text.
Default is yellow.
</DD>

<DT>font_name</DT>
<DD>This specifies the style or exact name for the font to use
in the Code and Dump windows. This font should be monospaced.
Default is "Monospaced".
</DD>

<DT>font_size</DT>
<DD>Define the font size to use. May be specified independently of
font_name. Default is 10.0.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>Basic operational functions are supplied in the menus.
Certain menu items are disabled or altered based on context.
For example, you can't "Close" a disassembly if none is open.

<DL>
<DT>File->New</DT>
<DD>Open a dialog to load a new COM file for disassembly.
This will discard any currently disassembly.
</DD>
<DT>File->Close</DT>
<DD>This will discard any currently disassembly, effectively "closing" it.
</DD>
<DT>File->Generate ASM</DT>
<DD>Generates an ASM file for the current disassembly.
file is generated in the same folder as the COM file.
</DD>
<DT>File->Generate PRN</DT>
<DD>Generates a PRN (listing) file for the current disassembly.
file is generated in the same folder as the COM file.
</DD>
<DT>File->Save DZ</DT>
<DD>Generates a DZ file for the current disassembly.
file is generated in the same folder as the COM file.
</DD>
<DT>File->Load DZ</DT>
<DD>Open a dialog to loads a DZ file for the current disassembly.
This replaces any existing breaks or symbols, effectively discarding those.
This does not affect the folder used to generate output files.
</DD>
<DT>File->Quit</DT>
<DD>Discards any current disassembly and exits the program.
</DD>

<DT>Disas->Rebuild Symtab</DT>
<DD>Discards any current symbols and rescans code according to
current breaks, building a new symbol table.
</DD>
<DT>Disas->Use {MAC80|Zilog}</DT>
<DD>Change mnemonics used for disassembly of code.
Menu reflects the opposite of the current mnemonics, i.e.
what the mnemonics will be changed to.
</DD>

<DT>Help->Show Help</DT>
<DD>Display this help document.
</DD>

</DL>

<P>Navigation is provided through modern keyboard commands:

<DL>
<DT>Home</DT>
<DD>Jump to the first line in window.</DD>
<DT>End</DT>
<DD>Jump to the last line in window.</DD>
<DT>Shift+Home</DT>
<DD>Jump to the first "window" in the program.</DD>
<DT>Shift+End</DT>
<DD>Jump to the last "window" in the program.</DD>
<DT>Page Up</DT>
<DD>Move one screen-full up (back) in the program.</DD>
<DT>Page Down</DT>
<DD>Move one screen-full down (forward) in the program.</DD>
<DT>(Up Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Move one screen-line up (back) in the program.</DD>
<DT>(Down Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Move one screen-line down (forward) in the program.</DD>
<DT>(Left Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Move one byte up (back) in the program.
Note that this can
(temporarely) throw-off the code display, as indicated by a darker cursor.</DD>
<DT>(Down Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Move one byte down (forward) in the program.
Note that this can
(temporarely) throw-off the code display, as indicated by a darker cursor.</DD>
</DL>

<P>The following disassembly keyboard commands are recognized:

<DL>
<DT>A</DT>
<DD>goto an Address. This activated the "A(ddr):" text box
below the menu bar, which can only be deactivated by pressing ENTER.
Type the 4-digit hex address desired, or leave empty to cancel.</DD>
<DT>F</DT>
<DD>Follow the address in the current instruction or DW (if a label).</DD>
<DT>I</DT>
<DD>Set an Instruction break.</DD>
<DT>B</DT>
<DD>Set a DB break. Length of each DB is 16 bytes maximum,
or until the next break change.</DD>
<DT>C</DT>
<DD>Set a DB character break. Same as 'B'.</DD>
<DT>L</DT>
<DD>Set a DW label (address) break.</DD>
<DT>T</DT>
<DD>Set a DB/DW table, char and label (address) break.</DD>
<DT>Q</DT>
<DD>Set a DW/DW table, word and label (address) break.</DD>
<DT>S</DT>
Set a DS field, until the next break change.</DD>
<DT>W</DT>
<DD>Set a DW (word) numeric break.</DD>
<DT>X</DT>
<DD>Set a DW numeric break, big-endian.</DD>
<DT>R</DT>
<DD>Set a DW relative address break.</DD>
<DT>$</DT>
<DD>Set a DB '$'-terminated string break.
Long lines are currently not split.</DD>
<DT>0</DT>
<DD>Set a DB 0-terminated string break.
Long lines are currently not split.</DD>
<DT>7</DT>
<DD>Set a DB 7th-bit-terminated string break.
Long lines are currently not split.</DD>
<DT>M</DT>
<DD>Set DB style to "Messages", i.e. character strings when possible.
(default)
</DD>
<DT>N</DT>
<DD>Set DB style to "Numbers".
</DD>
<DT>H</DT>
<DD>Set radix for numbers to Hex.
</DD>
<DT>D</DT>
<DD>Set radix for numbers to Decimal.
</DD>
<DT>D</DT>
<DD>Set radix for (byte) numbers to Binary.
</DD>
</DL>

This program is still very preliminary, and exact functionality is still being worked out.
But it is possible to examine COM files and generate usable ASM or PRN output.
Currently, only COM files ORGed at 0100H can be used.
