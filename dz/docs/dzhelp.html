<P>The JAR file DazzleStar.jar implements a modern version of
John Washington's famous DazzleStar interactive disassembler.

<UL><PRE>java -jar DazzleStar.jar [options]</PRE></UL>

<P>The configuration of the disassembler is customized by the configuration
file, which  is searched for in the following way:
<OL>
<LI>The current directory is searched for "dzrc"
<LI>The path "~/.dzrc" is used (user's home directory)
</OL>
This file is plain text and consists
of lines in the format "property = value".

<P>Sub-topics:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="dzcust.html">Customization</A>
<LI><A HREF="dzmenu.html">Menu Functions</A>
<LI><A HREF="dzkeys.html">Keyboard Functions</A>
</UL>

<P>This program is still very preliminary, and exact functionality is still being worked out.
But it is possible to examine COM files and generate usable ASM or PRN output.
Currently, only COM files ORGed at 0100H can be used.
