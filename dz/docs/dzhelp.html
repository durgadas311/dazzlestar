<P>The JAR file DazzleStar.jar implements a modern version of
John Washington's famous DazzleStar interactive disassembler.

<UL><PRE>java -jar DazzleStar.jar [options]</PRE></UL>

<P>The configuration of the disassembler is customized by the configuration
file, which  is searched for in the following way:
<OL>
<LI>The current directory is searched for "dzrc"
<LI>The path "~/.dzrc" is used (user's home directory)
</OL>
This file is plain text and consists
of lines in the format "property = value".

<P>If a program file is given on the commandline, it is assumed
to be a COM file (or at least ORGed at 0x0100), although the file type (suffix)
will be checked for certain recognized strings. The tails "HEX", "PRL", "SPR",
and "REL" (upper/lower case) identify their respective file types.

<P>The keyword "ZILOG" or "MAC80" may be given on the commandline,
to override the default/initial instruction mnemonics.

<P>The basic principal of disassembly uses "breaks" to establish
the starting points for instructions or various types of data, as well
as number style and radix (for data breaks). A break takes effect
from the point it is set until the next break of the same type.
In addition, data breaks will typically force a line break.
In other words, setting a break forces a change
in the flow of the disassembled code.
Breaks are described in the <B>Keyboard Functions</B> section.

<P>Sub-topics:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="dzcust.html">Customization</A>
<LI><A HREF="dzmenu.html">Menu Functions</A>
<LI><A HREF="dzkeys.html">Keyboard Functions</A>
<LI><A HREF="dzwork.html">Workflow Principles</A>
</UL>

<P>This program is still evolving, but contains a powerful core set of
functionality. The code scanner allows for tracing through the program
from known entry point(s) to locate code that might be executed, and thus
helps quickly identify code vs. data sections.
