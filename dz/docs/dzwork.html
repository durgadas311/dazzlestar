<H2>DazzleStar Workflow</H2>

<H3>Starting from scratch</H3>

<P>The general workflow when starting a new disassembly is:

<OL>
<LI><B>File->New</B> and select COM file. There is not normally a DZ file to accompany it.
<LI>Identify/register functions that use inline parameters (parameters follow the
CALL instruction). Use <B>File->Load Hints</B> to add these to the session. See TBD.
<LI>Set location to entry point (normally 0100H) and select <B>Disas->Scan from here</B>.
<LI>Use <B>F3</B> to locate each orphaned section of code, decide if it is code or data,
and (if code) run <B>Disas->Scan from here</B>. If not code, data breaks may be set.
<LI>Each scan may introduce new orphaned sections, so repeat until no more exist.
<LI>Use <B>F4</B> to locate unknown sections and determine use. Run scan or set data
breaks as appropriate.
</OL>

<P>Note that hints are only used during scanning, where they result in
insertion of breaks in instruction streams. Hints should be loaded
before any scanning is done (or else scanning should be reset and started over.

<H3>Saving disassembly</H3>

<P>Use <B>File->Save DZ</B> to record current progress of disassembly.
Note the scan results are lost when you exit DazzleStar, or if you start
a new project. Hints should have manually created and should be available
next time. Note that hints affect both scanning and final disassembly
(ASM or PRN output), and so should always be loaded (if present).

<H3>Resuming prior disassembly</H3>

<P>To resume a prior disassembly session:

<OL>
<LI><B>File->New</B> and select COM file. This should also load the prior DZ file.
<LI><B>File->Load Hints</B> and select hint file.
<LI>If more scanning is required, start with the scan steps.
<LI>Continue locating un-identified sections and identify them.
</OL>
