<H2>DazzleStar Keyboard Commands</H2>

<P>Navigation is provided through modern keyboard controls:

<DL>
<DT>Home</DT>
<DD>Jump to the first line in window.</DD>
<DT>End</DT>
<DD>Jump to the last line in window.</DD>
<DT>Shift+Home</DT>
<DD>Jump to the first "window" in the program.</DD>
<DT>Shift+End</DT>
<DD>Jump to the last "window" in the program.</DD>
<DT>Alt+Home</DT>
<DD>Redisplay with current line at top of window.</DD>
<DT>Page Up</DT>
<DD>Move one screen-full up (back) in the program.</DD>
<DT>Page Down</DT>
<DD>Move one screen-full down (forward) in the program.</DD>
<DT>(Up Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Move one screen-line up (back) in the program.</DD>
<DT>(Down Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Move one screen-line down (forward) in the program.</DD>
<DT>Shift+(Up Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Scroll one screen-line up (back) in the program.
Cursor remains in same relative screen position.</DD>
<DT>Shift+(Down Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Scroll one screen-line down (forward) in the program.
Cursor remains in same relative screen position.</DD>
<DT>Ctrl+(Up Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Decrease the size of the code window by 1 line. Minimum is 4 lines.</DD>
<DT>Ctrl+(Down Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Increase the size of the code window by 1 line.</DD>
<DT>Alt+(Up Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Decrease the size of the dump window by 1 line. Minimum is 2 lines.</DD>
<DT>Alt+(Down Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Increase the size of the dump window by 1 line.</DD>
<DT>(Left Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Move one byte up (back) in the program.
Note that this can
(temporarely) throw-off the code display, as indicated by a darker cursor color.</DD>
<DT>(Right Arrow)</DT>
<DD>Move one byte down (forward) in the program.
Note that this can
(temporarely) throw-off the code display, as indicated by a darker cursor color.</DD>
<DT>F1</DT>
<DD>Start new search. 
See <A HREF="dzsearch.html">Searching</A>.
Search is confined to current segment.</DD>
<DT>Shift+F1</DT>
<DD>Start new search for references to current address.
Only instructions (currently under "I" breaks) or addresses of L, T, Q, R breaks
are scanned.
Search is confined to current segment.</DD>
<DT>Ctrl+F1</DT>
<DD>Start new search for references to operand of current instruction
(or address of L, T, Q, R breaks).
Search is confined to current segment.</DD>
<DT>F2</DT>
<DD>Search next using criteria setup by F1.
If not wrapping at end, stops when reaching start address (F1).
Resets search after "not found".</DD>
<DT>Shift+F2</DT>
<DD>Search next reference as set by Shift+F1 or Ctrl+F1.</DD>
<DT>Ctrl+F2</DT>
<DD>Search next reference as set by Shift+F1 or Ctrl+F1.</DD>
<DT>F3</DT>
<DD>Locate next "orphaned" section of program, after a scan.
Search is confined to current segment.</DD>
<DT>Shift+F3</DT>
<DD>Locate next break in program. Any change of break, style or radix
will stop search.
Search is confined to current segment.</DD>
<DT>Ctrl+F3</DT>
<DD>Locate next symbol (address with defined label) in program.
Search is confined to current segment.</DD>
<DT>F4</DT>
<DD>Locate next unknmown section of program, after all scanning.
Search is confined to current segment.</DD>
<DT>F5</DT>
<DD>Cycle between program segments, if the program has more than one segment.</DD>
</DL>

<P>The following disassembly keyboard commands are recognized:

<DL>
<DT>A</DT>
<DD>Goto an Address. This activated the "A(ddr):" text box
below the menu bar, which can only be deactivated by pressing ENTER.
Type the (up to)4-digit hex address desired, or leave empty to cancel.
Address may be prefixed with "+" or "-" to make the new address
relative to the current address.
</DD>
<DT>F</DT>
<DD>Follow the address in the current instruction or DW (if a label).</DD>
<DT>V</DT>
<DD>Return to previous address before last 'A' or 'F'.
Stack depth is limited to 100.</DD>
<DT>/</DT>
<DD>Enter/edit minor comment for current address.
Blank comments are deleted.
</DD>
<DT>K</DT>
<DD>Toggle whether the operand of an LXI
(load regpair immediate) instruction is a constant
or a label. Ignored for all other instructions or data.
Not needed for files that contain relocation data.
</DD>
<DT>E</DT>
<DD>Define current address to be an execution "entry point",
e.g. a code orphan (found during scans) that is
determined to be executable instructions.</DD>
<DT>G</DT>
<DD>Get the <U>target</U> of the current instruction or data item
as an execution "entry point", which may not otherwise be
followed during code scanning.
If the cursor line does not contain a target address (within the program),
this key is ignored.
</DD>
<DT>P</DT>
<DD>Using the CALL at the currrent address, define an
inline-parameter hint.
If the cursor is not at a CALL instruction, this key is ignored.
The call address is computed,
only the inline-parameter field is entered.
Hint is applied.
See <A HREF="dzhints.html">Hint Syntax</A>.
</DD>
<P>
<DT>&lt;space&gt;</DT>
<DD>Clear (remove) all breaks for the current address.
Clears any data, style, and radix breaks.
<DT>I</DT>
<DD>Set an Instruction break. (default)</DD>
<DT>B</DT>
<DD>Set a DB break. Length of each DB line is limited to 80 columns,
or until the next break change or defined symbol.</DD>
<DT>C</DT>
<DD>Set a DB character break. Same as 'B'.</DD>
<DT>L</DT>
<DD>Set a DW label (address) break.</DD>
<DT>T</DT>
<DD>Set a DB/DW table, char and label (address) break.</DD>
<DT>Q</DT>
<DD>Set a DW/DW table, word and label (address) break.</DD>
<DT>S</DT>
<DD>Set a DS field, until the next break change or defined symbol.</DD>
<DT>W</DT>
<DD>Set a DW (word) numeric break.</DD>
<DT>X</DT>
<DD>Set a DW numeric break, big-endian.</DD>
<DT>R</DT>
<DD>Set a DW relative address break.</DD>
<DT>$</DT>
<DD>Set a DB '$'-terminated string break.
Long lines are split as for 'B'.</DD>
<DT>0</DT>
<DD>Set a DB 0-terminated string break.
Long lines are split as for 'B'.</DD>
<DT>7</DT>
<DD>Set a DB 7th-bit-terminated string break.
Long lines are split as for 'B'.</DD>
<P>
<DT>M</DT>
<DD>Set DB style to "Messages", i.e. character strings when possible.
(default)
</DD>
<DT>N</DT>
<DD>Set DB style to "Numbers".
</DD>
<P>
<DT>H</DT>
<DD>Set radix for numbers to Hex. (default)
</DD>
<DT>D</DT>
<DD>Set radix for numbers to Decimal.
</DD>
<DT>2</DT>
<DD>Set radix for (byte) numbers to Binary.
</DD>
