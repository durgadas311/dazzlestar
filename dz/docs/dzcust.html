<H2>DazzleStar Configuration</H2>

<P>The configuration of the disassembler is driven by the configuration
file, which  is searched in the following way:
<OL>
<LI>The current directory is searched for "dzrc"
<LI>The path "~/.dzrc" is used (user's home directory)
</OL>
This file is plain text and consists
of lines in the format "property = value". Long values may be extended to
subsequent lines by using the back-slash to cause the subsequent line
to be attached to the value.

<P>The following properties control the basic functioning of the virtual
computer:

<DL>
<DT>code_win</DT>
<DD>The number of lines to display in the "Code Window" (disassemble code).
Default is 24.
</DD>

<DT>dump_win</DT>
<DD>The number of lines to display in the "Dump Window" (hex dump).
Default is 6.
</DD>

<DT>cursor_color</DT>
<DD>This selects the color to use for the "cursor" highlights in
the Code and Dump windows.
Note that this, background, and font_color need to be sufficiently contrasting.
The value is a 6-digit hexadecimal number representing RGB.
Default is yellow.
</DD>

<DT>font_name</DT>
<DD>This specifies the style or exact name for the font to use
in the Code and Dump windows. This font should be monospaced.
Default is "Monospaced".
</DD>

<DT>font_size</DT>
<DD>Define the font size to use. May be specified independently of
font_name. Default is 10.0.
</DD>

<DT>font_color</DT>
<DD>Selects the color for the font (foreground color) in Code and Dump
windows.
Note that this, background, and cursor_color need to be sufficiently contrasting.
The value is a 6-digit hexadecimal number representing RGB.
Default is black.
</DD>

<DT>background</DT>
<DD>Selects the color for the background in Code and Dump windows.
Note that this, font_color, and cursor_color need to be sufficiently contrasting.
The value is a 6-digit hexadecimal number representing RGB.
Default is to leave un-set, effectively using the JRE default.
</DD>

<DT>status_font_size</DT>
<DD>Define the font size to use for the status line/pane.
A Plain, Sans-Serif font style is always used.
Default is 10.0.
