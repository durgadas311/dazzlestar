<H2>DazzleStar Configuration</H2>

<P>The configuration of the disassembler is driven by the configuration
file, which  is searched in the following way:
<OL>
<LI>The current directory is searched for "dzrc"
<LI>The path "~/.dzrc" is used (user's home directory)
</OL>
This file is plain text and consists
of lines in the format "property = value". Long values may be extended to
subsequent lines by using the back-slash to cause the subsequent line
to be attached to the value.

<P>The following properties control the basic functioning of the virtual
computer:

<DL>

Default is 24.

</DD>

<DT>cursor_color</DT>
